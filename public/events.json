I have not seen a tiger physically but experienced it every inch I travelled. Pug marks, marking on trees, remaining of tiger kill, alarm calls by Sambar, Langur. Thus I saw tiger every day and every time.Our theme is if tiger is not sighted (people say it is sheer luck) then what. Then every other thing we can experience. Jungle reading with local tribe man, birding, and everything we come across on trail.",
